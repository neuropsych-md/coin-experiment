Stimuli
-------
There are 40 unique stimuli. 8 core-stimuli and 32 cue-stimuli. Each stimulus is
640x640 pixels.

The core-stimuli consists of a colored circle on a black background. The colored
circle is overlaid by black hatching and contains a white fixation point in the
center. The colored circle is 1 of 4 isoluminant colors. The isoluminant colors
used are: blue(RGB:123, 178, 208), violet(RGB:174, 152, 198), pink(RGB:217, 152,
158), and green(RGB:143, 191, 53). The black hatching is oriented vertically and
then tilted 45° to the left or 45° to the right.

The cue-stimuli are the same as the core-stimuli, but also have a cue that is
located to the left or the right of the center fixation point. The cue indicates
to the subject which stimulus feature is relevant for the response. The cue is a
small black circle with a white letter "F" or "L" in the center. The "F" stand
for "Farbe" and the "L" stands for "Linie", which are the two possible relevant
features of the stimuli that the subject needs to pay attention to. The cue
location is always on the side that matches the response required by the
currently irrelevant stimulus feature. The currently relevant stimulus feature
can map to the same or the opposite response as the irrelevant feature, thereby
creating congruent and incongruent stimuli.

Legend
------
A legend is used to inform the subject which rules are currently in
effect. The rules indicate which response (left or right) is indicated for each
color and each direction. ##TODO##explain more

Naming Scheme
-------------
core-stimuli: (color)-(direction)
  ex: green-SENW
      green-SWNE

cue-stimuli: (array#)_(color)-(direction)_(relevant feature)-(cue location)
  ex: 01_green-SENW_farbe-left
      02_green-SENW_linie-left

legend: legend_(color)(color)(direction)
  ex: legend_gbNW (the colors green and blue map to the left)
      legend_pvNE (the colors pink and violet map to the right)

rules: (color)(color)(direction)_(color)(color)(direction)
  ex: gbNW_pvNE (green and blue map left; pink and violet map right)

*****************************************************************************
* array#: 1-32
*
* color: green = g
*        blue = b
*        pink = p
*        violet = v
*
* hatching direction: SENW, SWNE
* S = bottom
* N = top
* W = left
* E = right
*
* The parts of a compass are used to describe the direction. "S"/South (bottom) and
* "N"/North (top) are used to distinguish between the top and bottom of the
* circle. "W"/West (left) and "E"/East (right) are used to distinguish between the
* left and right of the circle. The rules will indicate if the subject should pay
* attention to the top (NW & NE) or the bottom (SW & SE) of the circle to
* determine if the hatching is tilted to the right (east) or to the left (west).
*
* cue location: left, right

Generation of Stimuli & Legend
--------------------------------
Inkscape was used to create svgs for the stimuli(MiSIT_layers.sgv) and the
legend(MiSIT_legend.svg). Each of the svgs have layers that can be turned on/off
to generate the various stimuli and legends.

svgtune is used to turn on and off the layers of the svg to create the
variations of the stimuli and legend.

Each svg file has its own svgtune file:
MiSIT_layers.svg = MiSIT_layers.svgtune
MiSIT_legend.svg = MiSIT_legend.svgtune
##TODO##explain svgfile?

To generate pngs with svgtune, use the following script:
generate_pngs.sh filename(MiSIT_layers.svgtune)
